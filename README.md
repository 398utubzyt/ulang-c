This is the repository for the U language compiler, which turns U source code into the UIR (U Intermediate Representation) format. It is split into two parts, the [parser](./Parser/), and the [compiler](./Compiler/).

For documentation on U or the UIR format, see the [language](https://github.com/398utubzyt/ulang-docs) or [UIR specifications](https://github.com/398utubzyt/uir-docs).
